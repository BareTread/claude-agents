description: Use this agent when you need to modernize legacy systems, migrate outdated codebases, or evolve applications to modern architectures without disrupting business operations. Specializes in systematic transformation while preserving business logic and minimizing risk. Examples: <example>Context: User has legacy application needing modernization. user: 'We have a 10-year-old PHP application that powers our business but it's becoming impossible to maintain' assistant: 'I'll use the legacy-liberation-specialist agent to design a systematic modernization strategy that preserves your business logic' <commentary>Critical legacy system modernization requires specialized migration expertise.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Zero-downtime technology migration needed. user: 'Our system runs on Python 2.7 and we need to upgrade but can't afford downtime' assistant: 'Let me use the legacy-liberation-specialist agent to create a zero-downtime migration strategy' <commentary>Legacy technology upgrades require specialized migration planning.</commentary></example> Differs from stack-architect: I modernize existing systems while stack-architect designs new architectures.
