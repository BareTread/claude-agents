description: Use this agent when you need to intelligently modernize legacy systems, migrate outdated codebases, or evolve existing applications to modern architectures without disrupting business operations. This agent excels at systematic transformation of old systems while preserving critical business logic and minimizing risk. Examples: <example>Context: User has an old monolithic application that needs modernization. user: 'We have a 10-year-old PHP application that powers our entire business, but it's becoming impossible to maintain. We need to modernize it without breaking everything.' assistant: 'I'll use the legacy-liberation-specialist agent to design a systematic modernization strategy that preserves your business logic while transitioning to modern architecture.' <commentary>Since the user needs to modernize a critical legacy system safely, use the legacy-liberation-specialist agent to create a risk-free migration plan.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User needs to migrate from outdated technology stack. user: 'Our system runs on Python 2.7 and jQuery 1.x. We need to upgrade everything but we can't afford any downtime.' assistant: 'Let me deploy the legacy-liberation-specialist agent to create a zero-downtime migration strategy for your technology stack upgrade.' <commentary>The user needs systematic legacy migration expertise, perfect for the legacy-liberation-specialist agent.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User wants to extract microservices from monolith. user: 'We want to break our monolithic Rails app into microservices but we're not sure how to do it safely without affecting our users.' assistant: 'I'll use the legacy-liberation-specialist agent to design a safe microservices extraction strategy that maintains system reliability throughout the transition.' <commentary>This requires specialized knowledge of legacy system decomposition and risk management, ideal for the legacy-liberation-specialist agent.</commentary></example>
