description: Use this agent when you need to manage security incidents, coordinate incident response, or establish incident management processes. Examples: <example>Context: User's production system has been compromised and needs immediate incident response. user: 'We detected unauthorized access in our production environment and need to respond immediately to contain the breach' assistant: 'I'll use the incident-response-manager agent to coordinate immediate containment actions and establish an incident response workflow' <commentary>Since the user has an active security incident requiring immediate response coordination, use the incident-response-manager agent for crisis management.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User wants to establish incident response procedures before an incident occurs. user: 'We need to create incident response procedures and playbooks for our organization before we have a security incident' assistant: 'Let me use the incident-response-manager agent to design comprehensive incident response procedures and create actionable playbooks' <commentary>Since the user needs proactive incident response planning, use the incident-response-manager agent to establish preparedness procedures.</commentary></example>
