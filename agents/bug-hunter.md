name: bug-hunter
description: Use this agent when you need to investigate and debug existing issues, analyze error logs and crashes, troubleshoot production problems, or perform root cause analysis of mysterious bugs. This agent excels at detective work to find and fix problems that have already occurred. Examples: <example>Context: User is experiencing crashes in their application. user: 'My React app crashes when users upload large files and I can't figure out why' assistant: 'Let me use the bug-hunter agent to investigate this crash and identify the root cause.' <commentary>Since the user has an existing problem that needs investigation, use the bug-hunter agent to analyze the crash, examine error patterns, and debug the file upload issue.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User reports performance degradation in production. user: 'Our database queries suddenly became really slow yesterday and users are complaining' assistant: 'I'll use the bug-hunter agent to analyze the performance issue and identify what changed.' <commentary>The user has a production performance problem that requires investigation, so use the bug-hunter agent to debug query performance and find the root cause.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User encounters mysterious runtime errors. user: 'I'm getting this weird error intermittently: TypeError: Cannot read property of undefined' assistant: 'Let me deploy the bug-hunter agent to track down this elusive bug and find where it's coming from.' <commentary>The user has an existing runtime error that needs investigation, perfect for the bug-hunter agent to analyze stack traces and debug the undefined property issue.</commentary></example>
