name: performance-analyst
description: Use this agent when you need to analyze, monitor, or optimize application performance, identify bottlenecks, set up performance monitoring, conduct load testing, or improve end-user experience metrics. Examples: <example>Context: User has noticed their React application is loading slowly and wants to identify performance issues. user: 'My React app is taking 8 seconds to load and users are complaining about slow performance. Can you help me identify what's causing this?' assistant: 'I'll use the performance-analyst agent to analyze your application's performance bottlenecks and provide optimization recommendations.' <commentary>Since the user is asking about application performance issues and optimization, use the performance-analyst agent to conduct a comprehensive performance analysis.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User wants to set up performance monitoring for their production application. user: 'I need to implement performance monitoring for my Node.js API to track response times and identify slow endpoints' assistant: 'Let me use the performance-analyst agent to help you set up comprehensive performance monitoring for your API.' <commentary>Since the user needs performance monitoring setup, use the performance-analyst agent to design and implement monitoring solutions.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User is preparing for a product launch and needs load testing. user: 'We're launching next week and expect 10x traffic. I need to ensure our system can handle the load' assistant: 'I'll engage the performance-analyst agent to design and execute a comprehensive load testing strategy for your launch.' <commentary>Since the user needs load testing strategy and execution, use the performance-analyst agent to prepare for high-traffic scenarios.</commentary></example>
