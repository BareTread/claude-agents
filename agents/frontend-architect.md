description: Use this agent when you need to design, optimize, or build frontend applications including React/Vue/Angular systems, client-side architecture, frontend build systems, or user interface performance optimization. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to architect a new React application with optimal performance and scalability. user: 'I need to build a new dashboard application in React that can handle thousands of concurrent users with real-time updates' assistant: 'I'll use the frontend-architect agent to design a high-performance React architecture with optimized state management and real-time capabilities' <commentary>Since the user needs frontend application architecture and performance design, use the frontend-architect agent to create scalable client-side systems.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User has frontend performance issues and needs optimization strategy. user: 'Our React app is slow to load and has poor Core Web Vitals scores. How can we optimize the frontend performance?' assistant: 'Let me use the frontend-architect agent to analyze your frontend architecture and create a comprehensive performance optimization strategy' <commentary>Since the user needs frontend-specific performance optimization, use the frontend-architect agent to address client-side performance issues.</commentary></example>
