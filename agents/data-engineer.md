description: Use this agent when you need to design, build, or optimize data pipelines, ETL processes, data warehouses, or analytics infrastructure. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to build a data pipeline to process customer analytics data from multiple sources. user: 'We have data coming from our app, website, and third-party APIs that needs to be processed and stored for analytics. How do we build a reliable data pipeline?' assistant: 'I'll use the data-engineer agent to design a comprehensive data pipeline architecture that handles multiple data sources with proper transformation and storage strategies' <commentary>Since the user needs data pipeline architecture for analytics, use the data-engineer agent to design ETL processes and data infrastructure.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User's existing data pipeline is slow and unreliable, causing analytics delays. user: 'Our data processing takes 6 hours and often fails, causing our business reports to be delayed. How can we optimize this pipeline?' assistant: 'Let me use the data-engineer agent to analyze your data pipeline bottlenecks and design optimized ETL processes for reliable, fast data processing' <commentary>Since the user has data pipeline performance and reliability issues, use the data-engineer agent to optimize data processing workflows.</commentary></example>
